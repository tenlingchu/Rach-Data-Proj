Description of dataset

The dataset contains the Sales and Profit of a Superstore chain which sells Office Supplies, Furniture and Equipment (Technology) in the United States.  The company has stores in 531 cities across 49 states which are then divided into 4 regions (East, Central, South and West).

What you learned
* The Consumer Segment recorded the highest sales in all the 4 regions and this is followed by the Corporate Segment and then the Home Office Segment.
* The West and the East region contributed 61% of the total company Sales while the south and Central contributed 39%.   
* However, when compared to the profit reported for each region and segment, the central region's Consumer Segement profit was lower than its Corporate Segment profit.  This is not consistent with the Region's sales by Segment.
* In terms of total profit, the Central Region's profit is only 7.92% of Sales which is lower than the South Region's 11.93% even though the South region's sales is the lowest.
* In addition, some cities made losses.  One of them is Lancaster with a loss of 73% of sales.
* In terms of profit by Sub-category, there is also inconsistency in the Table Profit where a loss is being reported.

What you'd do
* Put in place the generation of Exception Reports from the Inventory System.  An example will be to report items with negative Profit.  
* Centralise the update of cost across the state so that the cost for an item within the same state should be the same.
* Check on the costing methodology used in the cities with negative Profit for their sales.
